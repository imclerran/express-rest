# EXPRESS-REST

This repository is a learning exercise for me as I explore building RESTful APIs in Node and Express.js, in preparation for building a real project using similar technologies.

## Exploration topics

1) Node and Express basics
    - routes
    - controllers
    - middleware
2) ORM - Sequelize
    - db connections
    - models
    - migrations
3) Authentication
    - password hashing
    - jwt auth
    - sliding refresh tokens
4) Custom middleware
    - validation
